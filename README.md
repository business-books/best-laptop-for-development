# Best laptop for development
What is  the <a href="https://qualified.one/blog/dev/best-laptop-for-development/">best laptop for development</a> (Python, Java, C++, etc) in 2022?

Choosing a laptop for web developers can be tricky if you're new and don't know what specific tasks you'll be doing in the near future. Nevertheless, this process should be given some time to make an informed choice for the subsequent comfortable work with your favorite gadget.

*Why is it important to choose the right laptop for web programming?*

The laptop should have a sufficient level of performance for comfortable work. Why is it important? During the development process, a number of computational operations have to be constantly performed. This happens all the time when we write code. The software that is used for development is constantly calculating something in the background in order to give the developer results as quickly as possible. Many of these operations require a fairly large amount of processing power and sufficient RAM to work correctly. Therefore, the faster the processor and the more free RAM, the faster the result of changes in the code will be generated.

It would seem that a better processor can calculate a couple of seconds faster, but when we compare even a second with the number of identical operations even during the day, we can already get minutes or even tens of minutes of precious time every day. For a professional developer, this may not be any kind of handicap.

*Before you start choosing a laptop for web development*

A web developer is a fairly broad and somewhat generalized concept. Web developers include layout designers, front-end developers, and back-end programmers. Before you start choosing a laptop for web development, you need to consider the features of the work that will be performed. Even for those who are not limited by the budget, the choice can be ambiguous, as there are hidden points that are not written in the technical specifications. They are associated primarily with personal preferences and previously formed habits. Therefore, it would be nice to get experience with specific devices at least on a tactile level, for example, by touching them in the showrooms of stores.

Returning to the features of the work, it is worthwhile to understand that the layout designer works mainly with HTML / CSS, which is essentially text that is converted by the browser into a web page. The browser does not require significant computing resources, which means that there is no need for powerful and expensive equipment to perform such work. You can limit yourself to budget options, but taking into account comfort and convenience. A front-end developer who works primarily with JavaScript may have somewhat higher system requirements, and a back-end programmer may have even higher requirements. often you have to run several servers locally, incl. and databases or work using virtual machines. All this requires additional resources.

**Minimum required resources**

It is better to take processors of the latest generations and about performance at the level of the i5 / i7 series. In terms of memory, it is considered that 8 GB of RAM will be enough for web development. In most cases, this is true, but if you have a budget, I would rather take a model with 12-16 GB. This is also due to the fact that most modern laptops do not provide for adding or replacing memory. This is especially true for compact models, where the RAM is soldered directly to the motherboard.

The situation is similar with the SSD drive. By the way, the alternative to SSD is not even discussed today. For maximum laptop performance, this option is required. The minimum is to take from 256 GB, preferably 512 GB and above.
